 What happened after she got out of the orphanage? She found the old building where she used to live. And she went and sight-sighted it. And she started to have a look around. Um... What did she find in the building? These old pictures on the wall. And she found this old, um... Sort of like, case... thing. You've forgotten about the puppy? Which one is the puppy? Um... after she was thrown out, um, a puppy came running. And... Who did she meet in the palace? Um, a boy. Yeah. Two men. What were they doing? Um... You remember? No. They were trying to find, or they were trying to audition. They were trying to compute to pretend to be her. Yep. So they could get the money from the grandmothers. Um... Great story. Yeah. Where are we?
